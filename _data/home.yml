  Stephanie Seneff is a Senior Research Scientist at the MIT Computer Science
  and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. She received the B.S. degree in
  Biophysics in 1968, the M.S. and E.E. degrees in Electrical Engineering in
  1980, and the Ph.D degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in
  1985, all from MIT. For over three decades, her research interests have always
  been at the intersection of biology and computation: developing a
  computational model for the human auditory system, understanding human
  language so as to develop algorithms and systems for human computer
  interactions, as well as applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques
  to gene predictions. She has published over 170 refereed articles on these
  subjects, and has been invited to give keynote speeches at several
  international conferences. She has also supervised numerous Master's and PhD
  theses at MIT. In 2012, Dr. Seneff was elected Fellow of the International
  Speech and Communication Association (ISCA).\

  In recent years, Dr. Seneff has focused her research interests back towards biology. She is concentrating mainly on the relationship between nutrition and health. Since 2011, she has published over two dozen papers in various medical and health-related journals on topics such as modern day diseases (e.g., Alzheimer, autism, cardiovascular diseases), analysis and search of databases of drug side effects using NLP techniques, and the impact of nutritional deficiencies and environmental toxins on human health.
