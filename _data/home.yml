description: "She received the B.S. degree in Biophysics in 1968, the M.S. and
  E.E. degrees in Electrical Engineering in 1980, and the Ph.D degree in
  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1985, all from MIT. For over
  three decades, her research interests have always been at the intersection of
  biology and computation: developing a computational model for the human
  auditory system, understanding human language so as to develop algorithms and
  systems for human computer interactions, as well as applying natural language
  processing (NLP) techniques to gene predictions. She has published over 170
  refereed articles on these subjects, and has been invited to give keynote
  speeches at several international conferences. She has also supervised
  numerous Master's and PhD theses at MIT. In 2012, Dr. Seneff was elected
  Fellow of the International Speech and Communication Association (ISCA)."
